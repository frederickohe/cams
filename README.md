cam_system.py: This is the main program file where you create and manage the CAMS system. It will be the entry point of your application.

student.py: This file contains the definition of the Student class, which represents student objects. It should include attributes and methods related to students.

assessment.py: This file contains the definition of the Assessment class, which represents assessment objects. It should include attributes and methods related to assessments.

database.py: This file is responsible for managing the database, which includes functions for reading and writing student and assessment data to CSV files or another chosen data storage format.

user_interface.py (optional): If you plan to create a graphical or command-line user interface for the CAMS, you can place the code for this interface in this file. If not, you can interact with the CAMS directly from the cam_system.py script.

README.md: Project documentation. You can include instructions on how to run the program, explanations of classes and functions, and any other important information.

requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python packages and their versions, which can be installed using pip to ensure that others can easily set up the project environment.

data/: This directory is for storing the data used by your CAMS, such as student and assessment records. You can use CSV files or other suitable formats to store this data.
